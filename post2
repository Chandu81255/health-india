<p>To conduct the study, researchers used data from the cross-sectional&nbsp;<a href="https://bluehealth2020.eu/projects/bluehealth-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlueHealth International Survey (BIS)</a>&nbsp;— organized by the University of Exeter’s European Centre for Environment and Human Health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 18-country analysis included 18,838 people from 14 European nations, as well as Hong Kong, Canada, and Australia. The survey also included respondents from the state of California.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The research team asked the study participants to report their experiences in the following categories:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>current personal well-being</li><li>childhood experiences with blue spaces</li><li>current motivations to visit natural spaces</li><li>frequency of recent visits to blue and green spaces</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team also examined behavior concerning water quality, health and well-being outcomes, and demographic information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the childhood experiences section, the researchers asked the study participants to recall their exposures to blue space settings from birth to age 16. They also inquired whether blue spaces were easily accessible and if their parents or guardians were comfortable with the experiences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After analyzing the data, the scientists found that more exposure to blue spaces during childhood predicted better subjective well-being in adulthood. They also determined that the results were consistent across all countries and regions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We found a positive direct link between childhood contact with blue spaces and reported adult well-being,”&nbsp;<a href="https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/VALERIA-VITALE_nP1942935_EN.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valeria Vitale</a>, lead author of the study and PhD candidate at the Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, told Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our study showed that positive blue space experiences in the formative years of childhood may trigger enduring motivations to engage with natural spaces across the lifespan, facilitating more frequent nature visits in adulthood.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vitale noted that additional factors may be involved in how childhood experiences with blue spaces affect adult mental health outcomes and that other possible mechanisms may contribute to this link.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Childhood blue space experience may increase familiarity and sense of safety toward those environments and natural spaces in general, through repeated exposures,” Vitale said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><a>Are all blue spaces beneficial?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Healthline asked Vitale whether constructed blue spaces, such as swimming pools, might have the same positive associations found with natural bodies of water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vitale explained that although this study did not distinguish between different types of blue spaces and did not analyze potential differences in their uses or their impact on well-being.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When participants were asked how often they had made recreational visits to several blue and green spaces categories in the last month, our definition of blue spaces more specifically referred to all the places that contain water,” she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vitale further clarified that the study did not include indoor areas, places visited for job purposes, or private locations such as private gardens, land, ponds, or swimming pools.</p>

<h2><a>Health benefits</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frolicking in the warm waters of a sandy beach or taking a dip in an inland lake may provide benefits by affording opportunities for relaxation, recreation, and social connections. It can also be a way to engage in physical activity and increase&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-from-sun">vitamin D levels</a>&nbsp;through sun exposure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But more research is still needed to understand how blue spaces impact health and well-being.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Both green spaces and blue spaces can benefit mental health and overall well-being, and that’s why when you listen to relaxation recordings, they usually include sounds from both spaces,”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cerebral.com/care-team/therapists/christine-cauwels" target="_blank">Christine Cauwels</a>, LCPC, LMHC, a therapist with Cerebral online therapy based in Hillsborough, North Carolina, told Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re not exactly positive about how it works, but we believe it has something to do with enhancing certain emotions that directly respond to things in nature like peace, stillness, beauty, and calmness. In addition, we believe it’s a complete shift from the hustle and bustle that we’re used to, takes us away from our electronics and helps us disconnect from our worlds for a short period of time.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, blue spaces may provide benefits for mental health conditions like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/seasonal-affective-disorder">seasonal affective disorder (SAD)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Seasonal depression tends to be reduced by the combination of exercise and exposure to sources of light,”&nbsp;<a href="https://dralangoodwin.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Goodwin</a>, PhD, a psychologist in Encino, California, told Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If the particular blue space were to offer opportunities for exercise and exposure to bright light, it would likely offer help to those who [have] seasonal depression if the individual were to use the space in ways that produce those benefits.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still, repeated blue space exposure may be needed to promote mental health and well-being.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In general, exposure to natural environments carries many benefits but needs to be done regularly to achieve the best results,” Cauwels said. “Even if you can make it a point to do it at least 3 times a week for 20–30 minutes each session, you may start to feel some of the benefits.</p>
